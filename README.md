Ever want to play drums on your keyboard? Built in the process of self learning via The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp course by Dr. Angela Yu of App Brewery, one of London's top coding bootcamps.

Built as practice and as an example of what one could do with Javascript/JQuery, the ability to detect keystrokes and play sounds on a webpage.
